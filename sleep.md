# Sleep

## Practice
- Same sleep time every day.
- 8 hours of **actual sleep** per day. This means we spend 8.5–9 hours in bed.
- Do not drink alcohol, coffee or tea.
- Sleep in cool temperatures (18 degrees Celsius).
- Make sure our bedroom is totally dark and quiet.
- Exercise improves sleep, but do it >3 hours before bedtime.
- Don't eat heavily for at least 3–4 hours before bedtime.
- Sugar and carbohydrates reduce quality of deep NREM sleep. Yet another reason not to eat that shit.
- Consider meditating or otherwise turning off before bed.
- Use orthopedic pillow.
